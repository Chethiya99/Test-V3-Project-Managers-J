
Please generate professional marketing emails for the following merchants and their emails to pitch them. Please do not add any unwanted texts like "Here is a personalized marketing email for each of the selected merchants:" as we are sending the generated emails directly. Please separate each email using an invisible short line:

{merchant_data}

Email Structure Guidelines:

Create a personalized subject line for each email.

Dear 'use proper one'
Please For each email Use a unique warm and professional greeting (avoid repetitive phrases like "I hope you"). It's a must.

Maintain a conversational yet professional tone throughout.

Content Requirements:

Use the merchant’s description to personalize the message. Avoid any assumptions based on generic claims about market standing.

Highlight how PulseID helps merchants engage customers through trusted channels like banks and telcos — reaching customers where they already are, rather than relying on general social media.

Present PulseID’s value proposition in a professional, supportive, and friendly tone.

Include realistic examples of how PulseID supports similar types of merchants (without naming specific businesses). Focus on positive outcomes.

Suggest personalized offers based on the merchant’s category and description.

e.g., “Did you know that similar café businesses offering artisanal beverages are seeing success with weekday-only promotions to drive off-peak visits?”

Include a clear call-to-action aligned with the recipient’s goals.

Create emails that feel personally targeted and relevant to each recipient.

At the end of each email, include these interactive response options using HTML <a> tags so they can be pasted directly into Gmail as live links without manual editing:
